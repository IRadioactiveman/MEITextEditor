        <h1>Graphic MEI Generator Help</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the Graphic MEI Generator! This tool was designed to make it easier to create XML files containing neumes according to the MEI schema. Please visit the <a href="https://music-encoding.org/" target="_blank">official Music Encoding Initiative website</a> for more information about MEI.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Important!</b> The tool is designed as a single page application, which means that it is not advised to use the refresh or the back button. If you do <b>all your progress will probably be lost and you have to start all over again!</b> If you want to change any mistakes you made, please do so by hand or with the opportunities given on the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>UI</h4>
            The user interface is divided in three sections, on the left is an input mask where you enter all the data, right next to it is the xml output, which will change by your input. Below those two is a raw graphical output of the syllables and pitches you added.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>General workflow</h4>
            Please notice that every parameter you enter is optional except for the title of the work you are encoding! Also, if you save data, the current surface will be upheld until you choose to proceed to another step. As soon as you save information, it may appear like nothing changed, but try to keep track of your progress by seeing if the XML Output has changed.<br><br>
            The process is divided into a couple of steps:<br><br>
            Meta data:<br>
            This section contains general data about the work itself as well as information about the file itself. A title must be included.<br><br>
            Inputs:<br><br>
            Title: the title of the work<br>
            Composer: the composer of the work<br>
            Author: the author ofthe MEI File, probably yourself<br>
            Availability: availability of the file, e.g. publication status<br>
            Comments: comments for the method of encoding, for example special remarks in comments for syllables or for style of neumes
            <br><br>
            Source data:<br>
            This section contains information about the sources of the musical work. Multiple sources may be added, at least one source is mandatory.<br><br>
            Inputs:<br><br>
            Author/Composer: the author of the source<br>
            Source title: the title of the source<br>
            Location: the location of the source<br>
            Ownership: who owns the source<br>
            Date: release date of the source<br>
            Publication status: publication status of the source<br>
            Dimensions: dimensions of the source in a specified unit<br>
            Condition: the condition of the source<br>
            Extent: the extent of the source<br>
            Language: the language of the source <br>
            Handwriting: handwriting remarks of the work in the source<br>
            After entering the data and saving it you can add more sources or continue to add staffs.
            <br><br>
            Staff data:<br>
            This section contains information about the staffs, e.g. the lines the notes are painted on, including associated clefs.<br><br>
            Inputs:<br><br>
            Line count: the amount of lines the neumes are drawn on<br>
            Line color: the color of the lines<br>
            Mode: the mode of the work<br>
            After entering the data you have got the opportunity to skip any clefs or save the staff and add clefs to it.
            <br><br>
            Clef data:<br>
            In this section you can add the shape of a clef and which line it is on in case there are any lines.<br><br>
            Inputs:<br><br>
            Line: the line the clef is on<br>
            Shape: the shape of the clef<br>
            After entering the data and saving a clef you can continue straight to entering syllables or you go back and add another clef.<br><br>
            Syllable data:<br>
            This section displays the muscial content itself. First, there is the words that are sung, then you may enter the sung neumes and the corresponding pitches, including variations between sources.<br><br>
            Inputs:<br><br>
            Page: page of the syllable, extra optional<br>
            Line: line pf the syllable, extra optional<br>
            Staff: select a staff that you created before<br>
            Syllable: the textual content of the syllable<br>
            Initial?: indicates whether the syllable is an initial<br>
            Comments: a comment<br>
            After entering the data you cn save the syllable without any content or add neumes to it.
            <br><br>
            Neume data:<br>
            In this section you are able to enter certain neumes with and without any pitches. To make input easier, the basic neumes virga, punctum, pes, clivis, torculus, porrectus, climacus and scandicus are pre programmed in case you don't add any pitches, so do not worry if you suddenly get redirected to the neume surface. Also the length of the neumes is locked, so again you might be redirected to the neume surface.<br><br>
            Inputs:<br><br>
            Neume type: specify the type of the neume you would like to enter. If it is a climacus you also get to the chance to specify the length which is currently at a maximum length of five. You can add more pitches through the change values menu.<br>
            After selecting a neume you can just save it, save it and add pitches to it, add a variant or go back to adding syllables.<br><br>
            Pitch data:<br><br>
            This tab allows you to add pitches to a neume if not added automatically as mentioned above.<br><br>
            Inputs:<br><br>
            Pitch: the note or pitch<br>
            Octave: the octave of the pitch<br>
            From previous note: the relative note movement compared to the note before<br>
            Connection: describes a connection to the other pitches<br>
            Tilt: describes the tilt of a pitch in cardinal points<br>
            Graphical Variation: describes a graphical variation in a pitch<br>
            Supplied?: indicates another source the pitch is taken over from<br>
            Comments: a comment<br>
            After entering the data you can save the pitch, add a variant, add another neume or another syllable.<br><br>
            Please notice that you do not have to specify the page and the line of a syllable in every step, you only have to adjust those parameters if they change.<br>
            On the pitch surface, the "Supplied?" field can be left at "none", it only needs specification if no pitch is given and you reference that pitch to another source.<br><br>
            On each surface you have to save what you have entered before continuing to another surface or the information will be lost, unless a button says otherwise.

            <h4>Correcting errors</h4>
            From time to time an error will occur. If you are in the middle of creating the document, you can use one of the "change value" buttons on the top or the bottom of the site. You will be able to select the source, staff, syllable or any other element you created, and the on the right side you will see the current values of the selected item. You can then change the values, create new ones or delete values. When you are finished there you can go back to the respective form. <b>Watch out: the pre programmed neume types will not be considered in terms of auto completion if you use an "insert neume" button!</b> The pitches will have to be inserted by hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Graphical output</h4>
            The graphical output is for the unexperienced xml user to control his inputs concerning syllables and pitches. It is by no means 100% accurate, but it gives you the idea of what you are doing. First of all, there is only one octave displayed, so don't worry if you have two c's in two octaves and they are displayed on the same line. Red notes mean there is no given pitch, and blue notes are from variations. Logically, variant pitches without a given note are displayed purple.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Adding variants</h4>
            Adding variants is pretty straight forward. In case a source contains a neume which is non existent in other sources, while creating neumes as usual, you will find the "add variant" button in the neume surface. After you click that button, you may choose a source and add an additional neume for it. You can then go back to adding more regular neumes or another syllable. In case a neume only differs in one pitch one can also just use the "add variant" button in the pitch surface, thereby making only the pitch a variant.

            This tool does not validate your data against the MEI schema since proper Relax NG validators for javascript were not found in the creattion of this program. The tool has been properly tested, but to be sure you should consider validating the resulting MEI file yourself. I had good experiences with <a href="https://relaxng.org/jclark/jing.html" target="_blank">Jing</a>, an easy to use Java command line tool for validating Relax NG schemata amongst others.
